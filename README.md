## Database Structure

### Main Tables

- **profile**: User basic information (students, admission officers, administrators)
- **student**: Student detailed information
- **school**: University information
- **program**: Graduate programs (composite primary key: sid + pid)
- **apply**: Application records
- **operator_school**: Relationship between admission officers and schools
- **admin_applications**: Admission officer registration applications
- **files**: File records
- **student_files**: Student file associations
- **language_grade**: Language scores (TOEFL/IELTS)
- **undergraduate**: Undergraduate information
- **region**: Region information

### Key Relationships

- The `program` table uses a composite primary key `(sid, pid)`, where each program belongs to a specific university
- The `operator_school` table manages the relationship between admission officers and schools (one officer can manage all programs of one school)
- The `apply` table records student applications, containing unique identifier `(ID, sid, pid)`

## User Roles

### 1. Student
- Default registration type
- Can browse and apply for programs
- Can upload and manage personal files
- Can view application status

### 2. Admission Officer (operator/officer)
- Requires administrator approval for registration
- Manages all programs for assigned universities
- Reviews student applications
- Downloads student files

### 3. Administrator (admin)
- Highest privileges
- Manages all universities and programs
- Manages admission officer accounts
- Reviews admission officer registration applications


### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the project to XAMPP's htdocs directory**
   ```
   C:\xampp\htdocs\oas\
   ```

2. **Configure database connection**
   Edit `connect.php`:
   ```php
   $severname = "localhost";
   $username = "root";
   $password = "";  // Modify according to your setup
   $dbname = "test";  // Modify according to your setup
   ```

3. **Import database**
   - Create database in phpMyAdmin
   - Import `sql/OAS.sql` file

4. **Configure Apache**
   - Ensure `.htaccess` file exists
   - Ensure `mod_rewrite` and `mod_headers` are enabled

5. **Set file upload permissions**
   - Ensure `uploads/` directory is writable
   - Recommended permissions: `chmod 755 uploads`

6. **Access the system**
   - Open browser and visit: `http://localhost/oas/`
   - System will automatically redirect to login page

## Default Configuration

### Database

- Character set: `utf8mb4`

### File Upload
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Allowed file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, ZIP
- Storage path: `uploads/students/{student_id}/`

### Session Configuration
